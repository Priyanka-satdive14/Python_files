Every number, string, data structure, function, class, module, and so on exists in the Python interpreter in its own \"box\" which is referred to as a Python object. Each object has an associated type (for example, string or function) and internal data. In practice this makes the language very flexible, as even functions can be treated just like any other object."

    "- **Modular Design:** All employee-related functionality is encapsulated within the Employee class, making the code organized and modular.\n",
    "- **Abstraction:** External code interacts with the class through well-defined methods like get_employee_details, increase_salary, and change_name, abstracting away the complexity of the internal implementation.\n",

    "## Item Access\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful set of magic methods described in this section allows you to create objects that behave like sequences or mappings. The basic sequence and mapping protocol is pretty simple. However, to implement all the functionality of sequences and mappings, there are many magic methods to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Sequence and Mapping Protocol\n",
    "Think of sequences and mappings as little collections of treasures—whether they're items, numbers, or even random facts. To make your own collection behave properly in Python (following the \"basic protocol\"), you need a few magical spells... ahem, methods! If your collection is set in stone (immutable), you only need two of these methods. But if you want it to be a bit more flexible (mutable), you’ll need four.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__len__(self)`:** This magic method is like the bouncer of your collection—it counts how many items are inside. For sequences (like lists or tuples), this is the number of elements. For mappings (like dictionaries), it’s the number of key-value pairs. If your `__len__` returns zero, it basically tells Python, “Hey, I’m empty!” and your object will behave like it’s “falsy” in a Boolean context, just like an empty list or string. Imagine trying to use a dictionary that says it has zero items but is secretly hoarding a few keys… chaos!\n",
    "\n",
    "**tip:** This method should be your go-to if you’re obsessed with keeping a headcount of your items. It’s like counting jelly beans in a jar, but with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__getitem__(self, key)`**: Ah, here’s where the treasure hunt begins. This method is called when someone tries to grab an item from your collection using a key. If it’s a sequence, the key is an index (like an address in the list). If it’s a mapping, the key could be anything—numbers, strings, or your favorite movie quotes! Your job is to return the right value, or they’ll get upset (and by “they,” I mean the user of your collection, not your code).\n",
    "\n",
    "**tip:** Think of __getitem__ as your collection’s concierge. “Oh, you’d like the value associated with ‘pizza’? Right this way!”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__setitem__(self, key, value)`** (for mutable objects): If your object is mutable (meaning it can be changed), then `__setitem__` is your key to the vault. This method lets you store a value with a key, so later, when someone asks, “Where’s my value for ‘blue sock’?” you know exactly where you stashed it. Only mutable collections (like lists or dictionaries) have this magical power of setting and updating items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**tip:** Think of this as the inventory manager for your collection. It makes sure each item is placed under the right label. If you misplace it, don’t be surprised when you look up “banana” and find “wrench” instead!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__delitem__(self, key)`** (also for mutable objects): This one’s for when someone gets a bit... destructive. It’s called when they try to delete an item from your collection with the del statement. Not everything in your collection might be up for deletion, but for those items that are, this method is their final goodbye.\n",
    "\n",
    "**tip:** Think of `__delitem__` as the garbage collector. If someone wants to delete “old_tupperware,” this method makes sure it’s properly thrown away (or at least hides it where no one will find it again).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, if you want to make your collection behave like a true Python sequence or mapping, you need these magic methods to ensure everything works smoothly—whether you’re counting items, retrieving values, updating them, or even deleting them. And remember, with great power comes great responsibility! So use your mutable powers wisely, or you’ll end up with a collection that’s messier than a teenager’s room."

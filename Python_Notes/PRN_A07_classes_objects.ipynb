    "\n",
    "Design a parking lot system that can handle multiple types of vehicles. The system should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track the availability of parking spots.\n",
    "- Allow different types of vehicles to park in appropriate spots (e.g., a motorcycle can park in a car spot, but not vice versa).\n",
    "- Handle parking fees based on the duration a vehicle has been parked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes to Implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vehicle (Base Class):\n",
    "    - Attributes: license_plate, vehicle_type.\n",
    "    - Methods: __str__(), getters, setters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ParkingSpot:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Attributes: spot_id, spot_type, is_occupied.\n",
    "    - Methods: park_vehicle(), remove_vehicle().\n",
    "\n",
    "- ParkingLot:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Attributes: name, spots (a list of parking spots), occupied_spots (a dictionary mapping spots to vehicles).\n",
    "    - Methods: add_spot(), find_spot_for_vehicle(), calculate_fee()."
